# Development-of-Strip-Cutting-Machine-Using-Reverse-Engineering-For-BioMedical-Purpose.
In times of COVID-19, when the world was facing pandemic me any my colleagues redesigned Strip Cutting Machine which is efficient in use, light in weight, cheaper in production(respect to older version), cost effective. We visited the production house in Pune where Covid-Rapid-Antigen Test Kits were manufactured. Our team was assigned a project by our guide to develop a machine for cutting the strips which are placed in Test Kits.
